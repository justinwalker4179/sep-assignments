1.) O(1) is like an eagle flying while O(2n) is like a human walking.
2.) The best case scenario for binary search is BigOmega(1) which happens when the value 
    being searched for is the middle value of the array.
3.) The worst case scenario for binary search is BigO(log n) which happens when the value 
    being looked for is at the beginning or end.
4.) The middle scenario for binary search is BigTheta((log n)/2)

6.) The limit as n approaches infinity in that graph is infinity. 
7.) The graph is (2^n).

8-9.) Linear search has BigO(n), BigTheta(n/2), and BigOmega(1). A function that shows this 
      would just output whatever is put into it and the graph would be a straight diagonal line.

10-12.) See above.
