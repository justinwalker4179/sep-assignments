1.) The BigO of goodbye_world is 1 because only ever runs 1 time.
2.) Find largest will have a BigO (n) because it will always iterate over every item in the array once.
3.) BigO (n) again because it still runs through every item in both arrays only once.
4.) BigO (n^2 * logn). I can't point a specific reason, I just did the math and that equation fit the most accurately.
5.) BigO(n) the addition loop runs n-1 times.
6.) BigO(n^2) It's essentially a pivot sort.
