1.) Finding G would require 7 searches
2.) Finding G would require 3 searches
3.) Fib(9) = 34 
  + 21 
  Fib(10) = 55

  Fib(11) = 89
  + 55
  Fib(12) = 144

1.) I would use an iterative linear search. With a million
    items that deep of a recursive stack would cause a stack
    error and it's unsorted so binary search would be ineffective.
2.) I would use a recursive binary search. Binary would be
    effective because the data is sorted and recursive because
    the binary is cutting the number of items in half so the stack
    wouldn't be overloaded.
